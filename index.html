  <title>Three Whys Value Proposition Assessor</title>
  <!--
    This page implements a multi‑step assessment for building a value
    proposition using the Three Whys framework. It follows the
    SalesSparx brand guidelines by incorporating the official colour
    palette (teal, dark teal, red, black and light greys). The script
    manages transitions between steps, performs client‑side validation,
    invokes a serverless API to score the responses, and renders a
    detailed report with tailored coaching based on the role provided.
